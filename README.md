## Welcome to Cows & Bulls Game

Game Overview

Note: We developed this using Lovable AI, but the inner algorithms were designed by us.

Rules of the Game:-
1. This game is played with two players, where each player has to guess the otherâ€™s number according to specific rules.
2. When a player guesses a number, the other player responds with the number of cows and bulls
3. Bulls represent the number of digits that are correct and in the same position.
4. Cows represent the number of digits that are correct but in a different position.
5. If a digit matches, there is no need to mention those numbers separately.

Multiplayer Mode

  We have included a multiplayer mode where you can play with your friend using privacy mode.
 
Algorithm Performance
	
 Our algorithm is performing quite well; we are able to guess a 4-digit number in less than 6 attempts.
 
I hope you all have a great time playing this game.

Thank you.
